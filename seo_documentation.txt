SEO WORK

Main task is to promote the ranking of the website:-              

SEO can be a key factor to help you rank better for searches. 
Plus, image searches can be a hidden source of additional organic traffic.

Search Engine Optimization is one of the techniques used to improve traffic to a website by obtaining
a high-rank placement in the SEARCH ENGINE RESULTS PAGE (SERP) such as Google, Bing, Yahoo and others. 
SEO has two techniques to improve website position in SERP called ON Page SEO and OFF Page SEO:

ON Page SEO:
It refers to all the things that we do within our website such as title, description, content, image, 
keyword stuffing, internal linking, etc. Overall the on-page technique means structuring or building 
your website to be search engine friendly.

Off Page SEO:
Off-page SEO will help make your website popular on the internet, so you can get more visibility. With 
the on-page techniques we can get visibility in search engines. But only off page SEO techniques will 
help improve your website position in SERP.
